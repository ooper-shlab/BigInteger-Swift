# BigInteger-Swift

An experimental implemetation of BigInteger in Swift. Providing a single struct `BigInteger` which conforms to `SignedInteger`.

More experimental than practical. Better avoid using this code in your production apps.
(Though, the LICENSE terms permit to. Remember NO WARRANTY terms and do it on your own risk.
See license terms in BigInteger.siwft.)

If you are searching for a robust, stable and fast BigInteger library, better find one in C (or C++) and write a wrapper for Swift.

## Build requirement

Swift 4.2. I hope this code would compile and work with Linux vesion of Swift, but not tested.
